New functionality is implemented in different branches.

## Branch: unicode-progressbar

Displays awesome progress bar using unicode characters. If your console does not support unicode, don't turn it on.

* New command-line argument `-u` or `--unicode` that switches to unicode output.
* New config file option `unicode_output = 1`

## Branch: reactivation

Implements something silimar to [dynamic segmentation](http://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/support/segmentation.html). Finished connections will be reactivated on a different segment of file.

* There are no new config file or argument options.

## Branch: no-clobber

Skip files that are already downloaded (don't clobber from `wget`).

* New command-line argument `-c` or `--no-clobber`.
* New config file option `no_clobber = 1`

## Firefox cookies

It is not a good idea to read cookies from sqlite file, since firefox does not write all cookies to the disk. Instead there is a flashgot extension for firefox that integrates it with various download managers. I plan to modify flashgot to include better support for axel.

## Planned branch: content-disposition

Recognize `Content-disposition` in HTTP headers.

## Planned branch: multi-url-arguments

Give multiple files (not mirrors) on command line.

# Extra notes

I test my code only using HTTP connections on linux. Sorry, for potential incompatibilities, all fixes are welcome.

Original README and CHANGELOG were not modified.

Also, license from axel is unchanged.
